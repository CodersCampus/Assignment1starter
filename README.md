# Assignment 1 starter

- Use this template to create `Assignment1` in your own github.com site.
- Clone that down to your local computer **INTO YOUR BOOTCAMP WORKSPACE FOLDER** using your favorite tool such as the Github Desktop app which you would have installed on your computer.
- Open the `Assignement1` folder using VSCode which you would have already installed on your computer.
- Follow the instructions in the video coursework, excepting where this project does much of that setup work for you.

## Troubleshooting, Tips

- If you have problems getting the CSS or image files pathed properly, please see the examples set out for you in `example_paths.html`
- The easiest way to view html files for this assignment is to use 
File > Open > [browse to `brain-fm.html` file] in your favorite browser.
- Most developers - _but not all_ - prefer chrome as their favorite browser to develop in.
- Learn the keystrokes to format and save files so you can do so without even thinking - _**every time you make changes!**_
- Commit your work locally frequently (daily?), so that you can revert to a previous commit in case of unforseen problems, later. Also, good practice with `git`

## Assignment 1 and the "4 Hour Rule"

You may wish to regard Assignment 1 as an exception to the 4 hour rule, at least as far as set-up issues are concerned.

We set you up with the 4 hour rule so that you can learn to force yourself through the _ahem_ - challenges - of learning to research your own problems before you ask for help.

But getting an early win is also really important to your bootcamp. So getting set up for success with the first project might be one time that you don't push yourself through 4 hours of pain before asking for assistance. Use it as an opportunity to lubricate relationships with your new friends here at Coders Campus. This will be your home away from home for a while! 

A good time to make friends. _Don't forget, everyone likes the feeling of helping someone else through a technical issue._
